Yahoo BOSS Geocoder Example
===========

Here's a working example of how to use the BOSS geocoder
in node.js. The code snipped is copied directly from
Yahoo, with some small tweaks to fix typos.

Your code should be a lot more robust than this, but
hopefully this can help you get started.

Instructions
------

1. Clone locally

2. `npm install`

3. Add your `key` and `secret` to `server.js`.
   In real life, you'd put them in an uncommitted settings file
   or something similar. Don't check in your keys!

4. Run `node server.js`
